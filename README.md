## 🧙‍♂️ How It Works

The quiz calculates your Hogwarts house based on your answers to 12 questions (excluding question 10). Each answer corresponds to one of the four houses, and the house with the most points becomes your assigned house.

Your wizard type is determined directly by your answer to question 10.
